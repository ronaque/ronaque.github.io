## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

As just a begginer.

### What I learned

```css
body{
    /*Defini a fonte e tamanho dela*/
    font-family: 'Kumbh Sans', sans-serif;
    font-weight: 400, 700;
    background-color: hsl(185, 75%, 39%);
    /*Imagens no bacground, tamanho delas, posição, se ela repete ou não*/
    background-image: url(images/bg-pattern-top.svg), url(images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg);
    background-size: 800px, 800px;
    background-position: left -200px bottom 200px, right -200px top 200px;
    background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;   
}
```

I'm still not sure about this solution for the both bubbles as background, but i think it's a good learning for other occasion and i'm pretty happy with the result.


### Continued development

With this project i discovered the existence of the sass, and gonna take a look at it.
